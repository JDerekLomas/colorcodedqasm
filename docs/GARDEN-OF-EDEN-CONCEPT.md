# Garden of Eden - Fashion Archaeology Brand Concept

## Brand Vision

**Garden of Eden** is a luxury fashion archaeology house that excavates ancient symbols, sacred geometries, and forgotten motifs from human history—then resurrects them as hand-embroidered wearable art.

We believe fashion is memory made tangible. Every ancient symbol carried meaning: protection, fertility, abundance, transcendence. These visual languages have been lost to time, buried in museum archives and archaeological sites. We dig them up and stitch them back to life.

## The Concept

### Fashion Archaeology
We employ researchers who study:
- **Mesopotamian cylinder seals** - Tree of Life motifs, winged deities
- **Egyptian hieroglyphics** - Lotus flowers, scarab beetles, ankh symbols
- **Celtic knotwork** - Infinite loops, nature spirits
- **Mesoamerican glyphs** - Serpents, jaguars, celestial symbols
- **Indus Valley seals** - Sacred animals, geometric patterns
- **Byzantine mosaics** - Peacocks, vines, crosses
- **Persian miniatures** - Gardens, birds, florals
- **Nordic runes** - Protection symbols, nature elements

### The Process: "Archaeological Dig to Wardrobe"

**Phase 1: Excavation (Days 1-5)**
- Customer chooses their "dig site" (culture/era)
- We present archaeological finds: symbols, motifs, meanings
- Customer selects symbols that resonate with their story

**Phase 2: Translation (Days 6-12)**
- Designers translate ancient symbols into embroidery patterns
- Color palette chosen from natural dyes of the era
- Customer approves the "artifact translation"

**Phase 3: Resurrection (Days 13-38)**
- Master embroiderers bring the symbols to life
- Each stitch is intentional, each motif placed with meaning
- Traditional techniques matched to the symbol's origin

**Phase 4: Homecoming (Days 39-44)**
- Garment delivered with "Archaeological Certificate"
- Documentation: symbol origins, meanings, artisan story
- Care guide for preserving your wearable artifact

## The Four Pillars (Adapted from Morni)

### 1. Excavate Your Identity
Every person carries ancestral memory. Our symbols help you unearth and wear your deeper identity.

### 2. Know Your Artifact
Complete transparency: where each symbol comes from, what it meant, who embroidered it, and why it matters.

### 3. Connect with the Ancient
Wearing these symbols connects you to thousands of years of human meaning-making. You become a living archive.

### 4. Consume → Curate
Don't just buy clothes. Curate your personal collection of meaningful artifacts that tell your story.
